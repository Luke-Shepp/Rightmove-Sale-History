## Rightmove Sale History Extension

A simple chrome extension to fetch property sale history and place the data on search pages.

The data is available from rightmove, and is normally displayed on each property details page - however, that requires clicking thorugh to the property details and scrolling to the bottom of the page.

This extension makes the data more accessible when browsing properties on search pages.
